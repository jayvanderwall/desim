  ## This macro introduces several other templates locally for
  ## different actions. The ``shutdown`` template takes no arguments
  ## and is run once when the node is cleanly shutdown. The
  ## ``startup`` template is similar and runs on startup. The
  ## ``onMessage`` macro takes a port and a name for the messages and
  ## runs its body for each new message. Similarly ``onTimer`` takes a
  ## timer and message name and handles timers. A variable named
  ## ``simulator`` is automatically added to the environment and
  ## refers to the ``Simulator`` type that registered this
  ## ``Component``.

  ## ``desim_`` to the local namespace, so do not start your variables
  ## with this prefix to avoid collisions.
